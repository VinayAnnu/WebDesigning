            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents 
            designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <p>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, 
            which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines 
            the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
            maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged
            the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]
